# Life expectancy vs. health spending - Data package

This data package contains the data that powers the chart ["Life expectancy vs. health spending"](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/life-expectancy-vs-healthcare-expenditure?v=1&csvType=full&useColumnShortNames=false) on the Our World in Data website.

## CSV Structure

The high level structure of the CSV file is that each row is an observation for an entity (usually a country or region) and a timepoint (usually a year).

The first two columns in the CSV file are "Entity" and "Code". "Entity" is the name of the entity (e.g. "United States"). "Code" is the OWID internal entity code that we use if the entity is a country or region. For most countries, this is the same as the [iso alpha-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-3) code of the entity (e.g. "USA") - for non-standard countries like historical countries these are custom codes.

The third column is either "Year" or "Day". If the data is annual, this is "Year" and contains only the year as an integer. If the column is "Day", the column contains a date string in the form "YYYY-MM-DD".

The remaining columns are the data columns, each of which is a time series. If the CSV data is downloaded using the "full data" option, then each column corresponds to one time series below. If the CSV data is downloaded using the "only selected data visible in the chart" option then the data columns are transformed depending on the chart type and thus the association with the time series might not be as straightforward.


## Metadata.json structure

The .metadata.json file contains metadata about the data package. The "charts" key contains information to recreate the chart, like the title, subtitle etc.. The "columns" key contains information about each of the columns in the csv, like the unit, timespan covered, citation for the data etc..

## About the data

Our World in Data is almost never the original producer of the data - almost all of the data we use has been compiled by others. If you want to re-use data, it is your responsibility to ensure that you adhere to the sources' license and to credit them correctly. Please note that a single time series may have more than one source - e.g. when we stich together data from different time periods by different producers or when we calculate per capita metrics using population data from a second source.

### How we process data at Our World In Data
All data and visualizations on Our World in Data rely on data sourced from one or several original data providers. Preparing this original data involves several processing steps. Depending on the data, this can include standardizing country names and world region definitions, converting units, calculating derived indicators such as per capita measures, as well as adding or adapting metadata such as the name or the description given to an indicator.

### How is this data described by its producer - Global Health Expenditure Database, WHO, via World Bank (2026)?
Current expenditures on health per capita expressed in international dollars at purchasing power parity.

### Statistical concept and methodology:
The health expenditure estimates have been prepared by the World Health Organization (WHO) under the framework of the System of Health Accounts 2011 (SHA 2011). The Health SHA 2011 tracks all health spending in a given country over a defined period of time regardless of the entity or institution that financed and managed that spending. It generates consistent and comprehensive data on health spending in a country, which in turn can contribute to evidence-based policy-making. WHO converted the expenditure data using PPP time series extracted from WDI (based on ICP 2017) and OECD data. Where WDI/OECD data were not available, IMF or WHO estimates were utilized. Detailed metadata are available at <https://apps.who.int/nha/database/Select/Indicators/en>.

### Notes from original source:
The World Health Organization (WHO) has revised health expenditure data using the new international classification for health expenditures in the revised System of Health Accounts (SHA 2011). WHO’s Global Health Expenditure Database in this new version is the reference source for health expenditure for international comparison imbedded in a standardized framework. The SHA 2011 clarifies the financing mechanisms and introduces new dimensions which improve the comparability of health expenditures in the perspective of universal health coverage.

### What you should know about this data
* Population is the most commonly used metric throughout Our World in Data. It is used directly to understand population growth over time, and indirectly to calculate per-capita indicators, making it easier to compare countries of different sizes.
* We construct this indicator by combining multiple sources covering different periods.
  - HYDE v3.3 (2023): historical estimates from 10,000 BCE to 1799.
  - Gapminder v7 (2022): for 1800-1949.
  - UN World Population Prospects (2024): for 1950 onwards, including 2100 projections.
  - Gapminder Systema Globalis (2023): additional source for former countries (Yugoslavia, USSR, etc.)
* Breaks in the data may occur at the boundaries between sources due to their methodological differences.
* You can read more about the sources and methodology in our [dedicated article](https://ourworldindata.org/population-sources). We also provide a table of sources showing the source we use for each country-year.
* We calculate geographical aggregates (continents, income groups, etc.) by summing individual country populations. For years before 1800, we rely directly on HYDE's values for continents to ensure historical consistency.

#### Notes on our processing step for this indicator
### Combination of different sources
We construct our long-run population data by combining multiple sources:

- 10,000 BCE–1799: historical estimates by HYDE (v3.3).

- 1800–1949: historical estimates by Gapminder (v7).

- 1950–2023: population records from the United Nations World Population Prospects (2024 revision).

**Geographical aggregates**

- For most years, we calculate aggregates by summing the population of member countries.
- We do this based on [our definition of continents](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions#our-world-in-data) and the [World Bank’s income groups](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-bank-income-groups).
- The only exception is before 1800, where we use HYDE's estimates for continents (but not income groups).

For most of the years, we've estimated regional aggregates by summing the population of countries in each region. We've relied on [our continents](https://ourworldindata.org/world-region-map-definitions#our-world-in-data) and [World Bank income group definitions](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-bank-income-groups). The only exception is before 1800, where we've used HYDE's estimates on continents (but not income groups).

**World**
- Before 1800: we use data from HYDE.
- 1800-1950: we estimate the global population by summing all available countries in the dataset.
- After 1950, we rely on estimates from the United Nations World Population Prospects.
